# Artifact
##A Modern PHP utility libary for rapid application development

Artifact is intended to make you life as a programmer easier. 
It provides tools, patterns, base classes, and utilites you need in your daily programming life
which are not dependent on your Framework/Philosophy/whatever.

###### Inspired by Lithium, Hydrogen, Dioxid and many more. 

### Features
+ PSR-0 Autoloader 
+ PSR-3 Logger, LoggerInterface, FileLogger
+ Baseclasses for Obejcts and Parttern (Singleton, Adapter)
+ Collections, String Class

### Thrid Party
At the moment __php-error__ is activated by default. 

### What's to come
+ fully fledged Formbuilder
+ Validator
+ Storage management ( Sessions, ...)
+ Cacheing( Magic Caching, mcached, file cache, ... )
+ Events

### Requirements
The only requirement is __PHP__ __5.4+__. Artifact uses many of the new PHP features like closures, namespaces and late static binding so this won't work on older configurations. Sorry.

### How to use
Just include __bootstrap.php__ an you are ready to go.

### Note
Artifact is very young (in fact its about a week old as I'm writing this ). The feature set ist rather limited at the moment. And it's not really tested, so use with caution :) Also there is __barely__ __any__ __documentation__.
